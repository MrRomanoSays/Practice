Technology continues to accelerate at a rapid speed, and it has fostered an insatiable demand for leading-edge technology business products and the professionals who develop them. The JRS Coding School was established in 2016 to help bridge the gap between the demand for development expertise and the talent available in the marketplace.

Upon graduating from this 12-week immersive, boot-camp style program, successful students will be proficient at a junior professional level, able to build full-stack web applications using JavaScript. Students are also introduced to agile workflow, communication, and software lifecycle training to prepare them for working in a dynamic professional software development setting.

JRS Coding School is led by Tom Wilson, executive vice president and chief technology innovator. Wilson has extensive experience in building and leading teams in the development of large-scale and complex healthcare web applications. He is active within the Charleston software development community, is a member of the Charleston Digital Corridor, and heads the Charleston CoderDojo, which teaches code to children. Wilson chairs the Charleston JS Meetup Group and is an instructor and lead advisor at Charleston Code Camp. He believes coding is a valuable skill, whether one plans to use it professionally or to gain an understanding of the technical world. Recently, he participated at the Syntax Code & Craft Convention, exploring Functional Reactive Programming with Rx.JS/CycleJS.

Joining Wilson as an instructor at the JRS Coding School is Trip Ottinger, who has more than 20 years of experience in the design, implementation and consultation of custom business software solutions spanning multiple industries. Ottinger is a frequent presenter and guest speaker at technical conferences around the country as well as in classrooms and in e-learning formats.
