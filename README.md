About *JRS Coding School*
---
Technology continues to accelerate at a rapid speed, and it has fostered an insatiable demand for leading-edge technology business products and the professionals who develop them. The JRS Coding School was established in 2016 to help bridge the gap between the demand for development expertise and the talent available in the marketplace.

Upon graduating from this 12-week immersive, boot-camp style program, successful students will be proficient at a junior professional level, able to build full-stack web applications using JavaScript. Students are also introduced to agile workflow, communication, and software lifecycle training to prepare them for working in a dynamic professional software development setting.
